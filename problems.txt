Sets don't exist in go -> sorted list by child name
Can we create to directories in one go? e.g. if empty dir, does create(/a/b) create both /a and /a/b?
How to check if client is still alive? How can we test for this? maybe clerk needs state?
Similarly, how to tell when client is gone? only raft leader can write to fs, if raft peer cannot communicate, what then?
Can servers communicate to each other? This would be helpful for above (to tell the raft leader to remove ephemeral znodes relating to a client) and for sync (to tell leader to write no-op)? I think we have to have ZK servers communicate, because of only leader writes.
