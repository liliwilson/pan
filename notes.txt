Traverse path of imports

1. labgob
  - My understanding is that this just makes sure that
    things in the lab are able to work in Goâ€™s RPC library
  - Depends on nothing; root of the 6.5840 infra

2. models1
  - I THINK this creates the porcupine visualizations;
    so maybe not important for us
  - Depends on nothing; root of 6.5840 infra

3. labrpc
  - Simulates a network that can be sus
  - Depends on labgob (1)

4. tester
  - This is a package, so we go through each of the modules

4A. tester/annotation
  - Deals with porcupine; skipping for now
  - Depends on models1 (2)

4B. tester/clnts
  - Creates clnts, which define which servers clerks can
    talk to. may not be real clients
  - Depends on labrpc (3)

4C. tester/config
  - Creates a specific test; contains code to specify
    whether net is reliable, number of servers, &c
  - Depends on labrpc (3)

4D. tester/group
  - Each test can have groups of servers (example given
    is one group per Raft group). Also contains SrvGrp,
    which specifies 1 group of servers. Contains functions
    to (dis)connect and start/shutdown servers in group.
  - Depends on labrpc (3)

4E. tester/persister
  - This is used for the persistent raft state. Didn't look
    that much
  - Depends on nothing

4F. tester/srv
  - Has creation + helper functions for individual servers.
    I THINK makeServer creates a bunch of connections
    between servers in the same group.
    connect and disconnect let this server talk to other
    specified servers
  - Depends on labrpc (3)

5. kvtest
  - Various operations for checking a key-value server. i.e. puts
    occur at least once, checks work as expected, &c
  - Depends on tester1 (4) and kv rpcs (kvsrv1/rpc)

6A. rsm/test
  - Various operations for testing rsm
  - Depends on kv rpcs (kvsrv1/rpc), labrpc (3), raftapi (raft
    spec), and tester1 (4)

6B. rsm/rsm_test
  - Contains the actual tests. Uses the operations defined in 6A
  - Depends on kv rpcs (kvsrv1/rpc) and tester1 (4)

7A. kvraft1/test.go: LOOK MORE HERE FOR HOW TO SET UP VARIOUS NETS
  - Ops to create clerk, server, and start and stop them.
  - Depends on kvtest (5), labrpc (3), and tester1 (4)

7B. kvraft1/kvraft_test.go
  - Run tests
  - Depends on rsm (6), kv rpcs (kvsrv1/rpc), kvtest (5), and
    tester1 (4).

OVERARCHING:
  - All tests have a test.go script for common operations relating
    to the thing being tested, and a (name)_test.go for the
    specific tests

GLOSSARY:
  - ClientEnd: I THINK this simulates a single point a to 
               point b network connection
