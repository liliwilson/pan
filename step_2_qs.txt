SEQUENTIAL ZNODES:
- edge case: if i make a child called `seq-0` and then make a second child called `seq-` with sequential flag set
- possible solution: disallow numbers in non-sequential znode names?
- test for seq things with diff prefixes?

SESSIONS:
- using a google uuid package for generating session IDs, is this cool?
- timeouts
    - need to change the keepalive interval
    - need to change the session timeout
- StartSession
    - should I return an error if a session with that ID already exists, and we can retry with a new ID? or nah?
- EndSession	
    - should I return an error if that session already has been deleted?

EPHEMERAL ZNODES:
- if i create /a/b (recursive) as ephemeral, just /b should delete when i die?
    - right now, this is how it works
