Paritions are yes/no for all of the below:
  - reliable net
    - partitions (IF TIME)
  - servers can crash
  - clients can crash
  - (for all operations in the spec) contains operation
    - failure modes of operations (e.g. creating an already existent file)

Following partitions are more specific
  - One client, more than one client
  - Five servers, not five servers (I think this is okay)
  - Operations that can have watches having watches
  - files are sequential or not
  - files are ephemeral or not

IF TIME: Check for linearizability

Tests for partitions
Tests for leader crashes
Tests for client crashes
Tests for watches -- channels
